<h1>HTML Test Page 3 for Floppy from Italy</h1>

<p>
  This is a rather large and complicated Web page.
  It tells a simple story about my floppy-eared friend Floppy,
  who is from Italy. Floppy is a dog, I think.
</p>
<p>
  Here are two pictures of Floppy, which I took when I was
  in Italy in December, plus a picture of me, which Floppy took:

Without your proxy, you should be able to view this page just fine.

<p>
With your proxy, this page should look a bit different,
with all mentions of my friend Floppy from Italy
being changed into something else.  
The page should still be formatted properly.
