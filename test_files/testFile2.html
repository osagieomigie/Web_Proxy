<h1>HTML Test Page 01 for Floppy from Italy</h1>

<p>
  This is a more complicated Web page, with a link to a photo.
  It tells a simple story about my floppy-eared friend Floppy,
  who is from Italy. Floppy is a dog, I think.
</p>
<p>
Here is a
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~carey/CPSC441/Cute-Floppy.jpg"> picture</a>
that I took of Floppy when I was in Italy last year.

Without your proxy, you should be able to view this page just fine.

<p>
With your proxy, this page should look a bit different,
with all mentions of my friend Floppy from Italy
being changed into something else.  
The page should still be formatted properly.
