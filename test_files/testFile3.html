<p>
  This is a more complicated Web page, with an embedded photo.

  who is from Italy. Floppy is a dog, I think.

Without your proxy, you should be able to view this page just fine.

With your proxy, this page should look a bit different,
with all mentions of my friend Floppy from Italy
being changed into something else.  
The page should still be formatted properly.
